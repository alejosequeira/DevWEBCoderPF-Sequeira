                Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant,
                child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of
                non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.
                <br>
                Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create
                opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.
                <br>
                Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a
                double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and
                middle-income countries. There are multiple forms of malnutrition, including undernutrition (wasting or
                stunting), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related
                noncommunicable diseases.
                <br>
                The developmental, economic, social, and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are
                serious and lasting for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries.</p>

                <h2>What does a nutritionist do?</h2>
                <br>
            <p class="text">Although the word nutritionist is generally used as a synonym for the word nutritionist, the reality is
                that they are two professionals with different objectives in the area of ​​nutrition.
                <br>
                A nutritionist has a more medical approach and helps in the care of people with diseases such as
                diabetes or even sports nutrition. While the nutritionist is a person specialized in food, but with an
                approach more related to eating habits and lifestyle.
                <br>
                The nutritionist is a nutritionist doctor who has extensive knowledge of food and nutrition, also of the
                medicine that his patients can use and creates therapeutic diets.</p>
