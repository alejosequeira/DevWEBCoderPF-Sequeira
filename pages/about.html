            <h2>Importance of food and nutrition</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Although eating and being nourished are two factors that are interconnected, it is not mandatory that both are always present.
                <br><br>
                Eating is a process that people carry out when eating food, while nutrition is an involuntary process
                where the ingested food is converted into nutrients, which is why it is important to have a good diet.
                <br><br>
                To achieve good nutrition, it is important to focus on the amount of calories and nutrients each patient
                requires. You also need to know the eating habits you already have, as well as the hours you drive and
                your food preferences and intolerances. Knowing the diseases already present is also important to
                achieve healthy nutrition.
