                <h3>A Word About Diets</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Before we dive into the different types of diets, it’s important to note that none of these options are the
        be-all, end-all for your health needs. You can lose weight on just about any diet, so long as you’re in a
        caloric deficit (that is, you burn more calories than you consume). 
        <br>
        The same is true if you’re looking to
        put on some muscle mass. No diet is necessarily better than the other in accomplishing this. Prioritize calories
        first, and then choose a diet style based on your preference.

                Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant,
                child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of
                non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.
                <br>
                Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create
                opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.
                <br>
                Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a
                double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and
                middle-income countries. There are multiple forms of malnutrition, including undernutrition (wasting or
                stunting), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related
                noncommunicable diseases.
                <br>
                The developmental, economic, social, and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are
                serious and lasting for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries.
